Development of Secure Software
This repository contains code for two practical exercises related to Operating Systems. The first exercise involves developing a program for interacting with files in various formats, allowing you to modify, create, or delete them. The second exercise focuses on developing software to verify the cryptographic strength of passwords using brute force attacks.

Introduction
Operating Systems play a crucial role in ensuring the security of software. This repository contains code developed as part of two practical exercises aimed at enhancing your understanding of secure software development and cryptographic password strength verification.

First Practice - File Interaction
In the first practice, we have developed a program that allows interaction with files in various formats. You can use this program to perform the following tasks:

Create Files: Easily create new files in different formats.
Modify Files: Make changes to existing files.
Delete Files: Remove unwanted files.
The code for this practice is designed to be modular and reusable, allowing you to extend its functionality according to your needs.

Second Practice - Password Strength Verification
The second practice is all about enhancing password security. We have developed software that verifies the cryptographic strength of passwords using a brute force attack method. This can be particularly useful in assessing the resilience of passwords to hacking attempts.

Usage
Detailed instructions on how to use the code for each of the two practices can be found in their respective directories. Please refer to the README files within those directories for specific usage guidelines.
