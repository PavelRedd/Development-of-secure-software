# Development of Secure Software

This repository contains code for two practical exercises related to Operating Systems. The first exercise involves developing a program for interacting with files in various formats, allowing you to modify, create, or delete them. The second exercise focuses on developing software to verify the cryptographic strength of passwords using brute force attacks.

## Introduction

Operating Systems play a crucial role in ensuring the security of software. This repository contains code developed as part of two practical exercises aimed at enhancing your understanding of secure software development and cryptographic password strength verification.

## First Practice - File Interaction

The first practice involves developing a program for interacting with files in various formats, allowing you to perform the following tasks:

- **Output Information to the Console**: Display information about logical disks, including names, volume labels, sizes, and file system types.
- **Working with Files**: Utilizes various .NET classes such as `File`, `FileInfo`, `FileStream`, and others for efficient file operations.
- **Working with JSON Format**: Provides functionality for working with JSON data, allowing you to read, write, and manipulate JSON files.
- **Working with XML Format**: Supports XML file operations, including parsing and modifying XML data.
- **Creating a Zip Archive**: Enables the creation of a zip archive and the addition of files to the archive.

The code for this practice is designed to be modular and reusable, allowing you to work with different file formats and perform a variety of file-related tasks.

## Second Practice - Password Strength Verification

The second practice is all about enhancing password security. We have developed software that verifies the cryptographic strength of passwords using a brute force attack method. This can be particularly useful in assessing the resilience of passwords to hacking attempts.

## Usage

Detailed instructions on how to use the code for each of the two practices can be found in their respective directories. Please refer to the README files within those directories for specific usage guidelines.
